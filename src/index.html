                    <p>Think of a question, or a problem you are trying to solve, or something about your life you'd like to understand better. Then click the deck to pull up to 13 cards. Then make a playlist of those songs. That version of DECK can then serve as an audio tarot reading specifically for you. In fact, it likely will be yours and yours alone. There are over 635 billion different combinations/orders of 13 different cards/songs you can pull out of a 54 card deck, and so the likelihood of anyone pulling that specific set is extraordinarily unlikely.</p>
                    <p>We love you. Good luck.</p>
